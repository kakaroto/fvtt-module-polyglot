# Polyglot

Talk to others using a language you can speak and scrambles text you can't understand, into several fantasy scripts.

Currently supports Forgotten Realms DnD 5e setting, Golarion's Pathfinder and Old-School Essentials.
Partial support to Warhammer 4k and Starfinder.

## Installation

In the setup screen, use the URL `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kakaroto/fvtt-module-polyglot/master/module.json` to install the module.

## Usage

### Chat

A language selection dropbox is available above the chat text box so you can select which language you want your character to speak in. Text will be posted in that language only if it's an in-character message.

The list of languages you can speak in is the list of languages that the charactes of the selected tokens comprehend (excluding custom languages). If no tokens are selected, then the character that the user represents will be used.

If no languages are available (no tokens, no character selection), then `Common` will be available by default, unless you are the GM, in which case, all the languages are available.

Changing your selected token or character representation will scramble/unscramble text from messages posted within the last 24 hours.

As GM, you can also click on the language button (colored globe) to unscramble a specific message.

### Journals

You can write text in a specific script and only players who speak that language will understand it. By hovering the text they can see what language the text is written.

The owner of a journal and the DM can scramble/unscramble the text in their screen to see how it looks.
